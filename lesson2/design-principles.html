        <p>This home page for Tesla is a great example of Emphasis and Contrast. The first thing your eyes are drawn to
            on this page is the beautiful, blue, model Y. Tesla purposely uses the light grey shades surrounding the car
            to create a contrast between the backgorund and the car. This contrast creates en emphasis on the beauty of the car,
            which is obvioulsy what they want you focusing on.

            <h3>Proportion</h3>

        <h4>Apple</h4>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a><br><br>
        <img src="./images/apple.png" alt="apple">
        <p>The home page for apple is a great example of proportion. We learn from the design principle of proportion that
            making something bigger or smaller in terms of its proportion to the page can help show what is important. Apple's
            newest (and most expensive) product is the new iPhone 14 Pro. By making the image of the phone muh bigger than other parts
            of the page, Apple draws the users attention to their new product.

        <a href="https://www.zoom.com/">zoom.com</a><br><br>
        <img src="./images/zoom.png" alt="zoom">
        <p>Zoom is a very popular example of the consistency design principle. There is a reason that millions of
            people turned to Zoom when COVID-19 became a problem, it is easy to use. The UI for Zoom is extremely consistent.
            Whether you are on a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop, the interface and tools are generally the same. This Consistency
            is what allowed zoom to grow so quickly in a time of need.
